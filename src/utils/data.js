    text: "Each of the Richard Louv nature books I read is a gift, but his latest Our Wild Calling: How connecting with animals can transform our lives and save theirs was an actual gift from a friend of his. I guess that makes me a friend of a friend? I told my friend that I'd share it with you because that's what I normally do when I find something I think you'd like. And I knew you would like it before I even read it. I imagined I could give you a glimpse of the book or a teaser to see if you might want to purchase through our local and amazing Acorn Naturalist (who is offering a 10% off coupon). But the further I got through the book, the more I realized it is part of a bigger message from Louv that started with Last Child in the Woods.",
